Project Free Food is my C# attempt at making a console game, which I haven't yet determined the direction of. This project aims to be an ongoing learning experience in my development.

I'm aiming for something quite efficient, using low resources and very low storage usage, saving bytes where I know I can.

There will be issues in the code that you think I could improve, remember, I'm not a senior developer. If you see something feel free to open an issue and tell me about what you found. I'm looking forward to your help!

## Features

- **Basic Console Application**: Built with C#, this project serves as a foundation for developing more complex features.
- **Player Management**: Basic player management system with attributes like name, cash, health, and damage.
- **Localization Support**: Initial implementation of localization to support different languages or in-game messages.

All these are well said not done in any ways, this project is in early trial phase, I've just already done some requirements for it to be easy.
